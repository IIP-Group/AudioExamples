# mixtortion Example Sound Files

_The following is an excerpt of D. Wieland's Master's Thesis:_

All of these recordings were done on a guitar with active pickups (Fishmann Fluence Tosin Abassi). The guitar was directly connected to the left input of the mixtortion pedal. The left output was then connected to an audio interface (Presonus Audiobox USB 96). The right channel was not used for these tests, and the phase has been adjusted to minimize losses due to crosstalk. Because a direct guitar signal sounds quite harsh and not like the electric guitar sound we know, an amplifier and cabinet simulator have been applied. The one used is Archetype Nolly by NeuralDSP. It was set to a clean sound without any additional effects. The sound of just the amplifier can be heard in the bypass sample.

The files are named starting with the diode used, followed by `PB` for passband or `BB` for baseband, and finally how far the gain knob was turned up (these go to 10).
